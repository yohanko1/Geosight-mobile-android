Geosight combines the adventure of geocaching with the art of photography using upcoming photo geotagging technology. Traditional geocaching involves writing in a log book at each cache location. Geosight involves taking a photo at each 'sight' location, encouraging interesting and beautiful 'sights'. 
Geosight will harness EXIF GPS data included in photos taken by modern digitial cameras and mobile phones.
